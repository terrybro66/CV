## Terry Broughton

I am a software developer recently graduated from Makers Academy looking for a challenging role developing web and mobile applications using test driven development, modern programming frameworks and using Agile methodologies. My goal is to write software that connects with people in interesting and informative ways.

- I have built html templates for publishers to inject magazine content into using a content management system
- Created landing pages and banner ads to drive subscription revenue
- I have been an educator devising online materials for post-graduate courses
- Published articles on the use of algorithms to generate 3d emergent landscapes and delivered the results of my research to a major international conference
